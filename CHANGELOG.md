# Changelog

## 1.10.0-shadow.1

- Add host-local, exact-worktree account preference and new-session drain routing.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

## 1.10.0 - 2026-07-18

- Added `runtime.ultraReasoningEffort` to override Ultra's default `max` inference effort with `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`.
- Aligned Ultra's multi-agent mode prompt and inherited child policy with official Codex Multi-Agent V2 behavior.
- Added a pinned-source Codex-to-OpenCode prompt transformation, build-generated Ultra overlays, source/output drift checks, and compiled package delivery.
- Corrected catalog documentation for live-entry precedence, official GitHub missing-model supplementation, and Ultra eligibility provenance.

## 1.9.0 - 2026-07-10

- Refactored config precedence to keep explicit runtime mode authoritative and treat spoof mode as compatibility fallback.
- Hardened merged auth state active-account selection to avoid disabled active identity carry-over.
- Simplified request payload transform wrappers to route through one shared aggregate transform pipeline.
- Consolidated account action messaging with shared builders and tightened auth-menu wording consistency.
- Consolidated model-catalog stale-cache fallback emission flow and removed small dead helper modules.
- Retired the earlier collaboration-profile/orchestrator WIP, including managed prompt sync, collaboration headers, and generated `orchestrator.md` agents.
- Added the replacement GPT-5.6 Ultra agent mode as a WIP behind `runtime.ultra`, defaulting to `false` with provider variants and delegation policy hidden until explicitly enabled.
- Added configurable `runtime.promptCacheKeyStrategy` (`default` | `project`) for session-based or project-path-based prompt cache keying.
- Added quota threshold warnings at `25%`, `20%`, `10%`, `5%`, `2.5%`, `0%` and automatic cooldown/switch when `5h` or `weekly` quota is exhausted.
- Added account selection tracing and per-attempt failover reason codes for snapshot/debug observability.
- Added config file validation with actionable warnings on invalid types/values.
- Added upstream drift watch (`npm run check:upstream`) and native OAuth parity tests.
- Refactored cache layout + IO primitives into shared helpers (lock-guarded, atomic writes; best-effort persistence on failure).
- Hardened OAuth cancel handler: `/cancel` now requires a matching `state` value.
- Hardened local storage, snapshot logging, and trust boundaries across multiple security passes.
- Improved handling for accounts missing identity metadata: request-time auth acquisition can surface `missing_account_identity`, and status UI renders an explicit `identity-missing` badge and reset fallbacks.
- Replaced silent catches with explicit error handling throughout codebase.
- Reduced read contention and catalog fallback IO in storage paths.

## 1.8.1 - 2026-07-10

- Scoped `standard` and `pro` reasoning modes to GPT-5.6 models so older models do not receive unsupported reasoning mode values.

## 1.8.0 - 2026-07-04

- Added opt-in shareable debug logging with redacted sensitive metadata and crash-tolerant incident capture and recovery.
- Updated live Codex model catalog handling for GPT-5.6-era reasoning levels, preserving `max`, `ultra`, and future non-empty catalog values while allowing omitted config to follow each model's live default.
- Expanded supported Node.js versions to `>=22 <27`.

## 1.5.1 - 2026-03-06

- Fixed model catalog shaping to preserve source-faithful live catalog variants, including `gpt-5.4` `xhigh`, instead of field-merging GitHub fallback metadata into successful live responses.
- Added regression coverage for live-vs-fallback catalog variant behavior and config-variant overrides.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-02-13

- Refactored `codex-native` into focused sub-modules: auth helpers, OAuth method flows, chat hooks, transform pipeline, state/catalog helpers, loader fetch pipeline.
- Replaced `customSettings` with `behaviorSettings` config system (`global` + `perModel` + `variants`).
- Added secret scanning CI workflow.
- Fixed audit findings: preserved request metadata, reduced auth lock contention.
- Aligned cache metadata refresh and instruction ordering.
- Hardened verify and runtime safeguards.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-02-12

- Removed experimental `collab` runtime mode; simplified to `native` and `codex`.
- Simplified installer surface to a single idempotent `install` flow.
- Updated docs, schema, and workflow configuration for current supported modes.
- Fixed compaction: codex checkpoint handoff only in `codex` mode, with mode-derived defaults and explicit toggle.
- Fixed codex instruction recovery from fallback caches.
- Defaulted AGENTS developer-role remap in `codex` mode.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-02-12

- Added documentation examples directory.
